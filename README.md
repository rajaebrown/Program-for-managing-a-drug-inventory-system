<h1>Program for managing a drug inventory system</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple program for managing a drug inventory system. The program includes functions for login, adding, viewing, updating, and deleting drug data. It uses a file ("Drug Inventory.dat") to store and retrieve information about drugs.
<br />

<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
Nephron pharmaceuticalâ€™s is located on 12 Retirement Crescent, Kingston 5, Jamaica, W.I. The 
company discovers, develops and markets drugs or pharmaceutical drugs for use as medications.
The company was founded in 2010 and has since become one of the leading pharmaceutical 
companies in the Caribbean region.
Ever since the beginning of the company a file cabinet was used to store information within the 
organization. But recently, a fire destroyed all the information stored in the cabinet.
A solution for this problem is developing an electronic database system that will allow specific 
personnel to enter and save data to the system, which will make the information more secure by 
the implementation of access codes. The information stored will also be safer from disasters such 
fires as they can be easily restored.
